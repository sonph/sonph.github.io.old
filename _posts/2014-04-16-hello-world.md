I have always wanted to build my own website. Somehow though I never seemed to have enough time to do finish it. So finally after a few weeks developing my website from scratch it's finally up! And this is my first blog post. Hello world!

## Who are you?
This is copied from my about page. Head over [there](/about) if you want to learn more about me!
> My name is Son Pham. I'm a Computer Science undergraduate student at [UT Dallas](http://utdallas.edu). My interests vary, including (but not limited to) the Linux operating system, open source software, web development and artificial intelligence. Other than computers, I'm also into graphics and UI design, photos and guitars.

## Okay. So why are you blogging?
This site is my own little corner on the Internet (FYI, it weighs just a few megabytes out of the estimated [5 million terabytes](http://www.wisegeek.org/how-big-is-the-internet.htm) of data on the Internet!). It's my own playground. So you can expect to find that most of the content is going to be about me, my thoughts, works and occasionally things I find cool. These include software, graphics, photos and possibly tutorials.

## And how can I leave feedback?
Any feedback is appreciated! You can comment directly in the Disqus thread at the bottom of each post, provided that you have an account already (if not, you really should create one). Or else you can send me an email using the link on the left!
